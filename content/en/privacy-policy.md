-   Email address
-   Usage Data

Usage Data is automatically collected when you hop onto the Service.

We might also collect info that your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, whether on desktop or mobile.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies 🍪
We use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep an eye on activity within our Service and store some information. These include beacons, tags, and scripts, all used to gather and track info, and to fine-tune and analyze our Service. The tech we use might include:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file placed right on your device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not play nice. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the boot, our Service will likely use them.
-   **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might contain small electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These clever little things allow the Company, for example, to count folks who've visited those pages or opened an email, and gather other website stats (like how popular a section is or making sure our systems are running smoothly).

Cookies come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even after you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish as soon as you close your web browser. Poof!

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**

    -   **Managed by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital for getting you the services available through the Website and letting you use its cool features. They're super helpful for authenticating users and keeping those pesky fraudulent account uses at bay. Without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just can't be provided, and we only use them to make sure you get those services.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Managed by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies help us figure out if users have already given the thumbs-up to using cookies on the Website.

The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you from having to type in your preferences every single time you visit. Phew!

### Transferring Your Personal Data 🌍

Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting your info, you're essentially saying "okay" to this transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is treated securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your personal data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Deleting Your Personal Data 👋

You've got the right to delete your personal data or ask us to help you delete the personal data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you delete certain info about yourself directly from within the Service.

You can always log into your account (if you have one) and head to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. From there, you can update, modify, or delete your info. You can also reach out to us and ask to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

But keep in mind, there might be times when we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to keep certain info.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data might be transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your personal data if required by law or in response to valid requests from public authorities (like a court or government agency).

The Company might disclose your personal data if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:
-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
-   Shield against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data 🔒

The security of your personal data is super important to us! But hey, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure. While we totally strive to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your personal data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy 👶

Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your child has given us personal data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out that we've collected personal data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites 🔗
Our Service might contain links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit.

We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy 📝
