# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday**! 👋 Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of this site means you're totally on board and agree to these terms.

## 1. Our Services — What's the Scoop?
Our services are all about providing awesome paid subscription content and membership perks to our users! Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, community interactions, and more. 🚀 Just a heads-up: some of this cool content is exclusively for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts — Let's Get You Set Up!
- To register an account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Simple as that! 😉
- Your account security and all activities linked to it are totally your responsibility. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else!
- If you ever breach these terms, we reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just keeping it fair!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services — The Lowdown on Your Membership! 💰
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, and all fees will be clearly displayed on the checkout page. No surprises!
- All payments are processed through awesome third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, we **don't store any of your payment info** ourselves.
- Your subscription will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! You can always cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: For first-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. This refund opportunity is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise. Fair's fair!

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property — It's All Ours (Mostly)! 🧠
- Just so you know, all original content is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**! Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express permission.
- As a user, you get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure. Keep it to yourself! 😉
- If you're looking to use our stuff for commercial purposes or need to quote a lot, please get in touch with us for authorization. We're usually pretty chill, but just ask first!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines — Play Nice, Folks! 🛑
- **Don't even think about** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it.
- And definitely **no mass downloading, scraping, or cracking** our member content using any technical trickery. That's a big no-no!
- We totally reserve the right to remove any inappropriate content and **ban users** who don't play by the rules. You've been warned! 👮

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions — Life Happens! 🤷‍♀️
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up beforehand. It's just how these things work!
- If, by some crazy chance, content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control like force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service outages, we **won't be liable for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it's out of our hands.

## 7. Disclaimer — Read This Bit! ⚠️
- Heads up! The info we provide on this site is purely for general reference. It **doesn't count as** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). So, don't take it as gospel!
- Also, we're definitely **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it clear!

## 8. Governing Law — Where We Stand Legally ⚖️
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without messing with any conflict of law principles. West Coast rules! 🌴
- If any disputes pop up related to or arising from these terms, both parties agree to first try and sort it out amicably. If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. So, you know where to find us! 😉
