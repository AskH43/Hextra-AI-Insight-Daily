# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we")! 🎉 Before you dive into our awesome services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're essentially saying you're totally cool with and accept these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
So, what's the deal? **The Site** hooks users up with paid subscription content and super cool membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interaction – the whole nine yards! 📚 Just a heads-up, though: some of that premium content is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To get started, **users** need to provide a valid email address and pick a password to set up their account. Easy peasy! 👍
*   Heads up: **users** are totally responsible for keeping their account safe and sound, as well as everything that happens under their login. And hey, **no transferring or sharing** your account – that's a big no-no! 🔒
*   If a user breaks these terms, **the Site** has the right to **pause or even close down** their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs super clearly on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💸
*   Relax, **all payments** go through trusted third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We never, ever store your sensitive payment info here. Your security is key! 🛡️
*   Your **subscription** will **automatically renew** – awesome, right? – unless you decide to cancel before your current billing period wraps up.
*   Check out our **14-day refund policy**! 🥳 If you're a first-time subscriber and aren't totally jazzed about our service within 14 days of buying, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and let us know why. Each user gets this one-time refund chance. But hey, if it's been more than 14 days, or you're not a first-timer, then usually, **no refunds** after payment, unless the law forces our hand. 😉

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   FYI, **all original content** here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so. Capiche? 🚫
*   **Users** just get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content for their personal learning and reading pleasure. Keep it to yourself, alright?
*   **Got a commercial project or need to quote us big time**? Just reach out to the Site to get the green light. We're usually pretty cool about it! 📧

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Listen up: **users are absolutely prohibited from** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harasses anyone, is false, offensive, or steps on someone else's rights. Let's keep it civil, folks! 🙅‍♀️
*   And hey, trying to **mass download, scrape, or crack** our member content using any tech tricks? That's a definite **no-go**. Seriously, don't even try it! 🛑
*   **The Site** has the full right to remove any dodgy content and **kick out users** who break the rules. Fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   Just so you know, **we** totally reserve the right to change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how it rolls! 🔄
*   If our content suddenly goes dark because of crazy stuff like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service issues, **the Site** will **not be on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it happens! 😅

## 7. Disclaimer
*   Quick disclaimer: **the info we dish out on the Site** is purely for reference. It's definitely **not** professional advice (like for your money, legal stuff, or health). Always check with the pros! 💡
*   And FYI, **the Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real! 🤷‍♂️

## 8. Governing Law
*   Alright, legal talk: **these Terms of Service** are totally governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA. No messy conflict of law principles messing things up here! 🇺🇸
*   Got a beef? **Any disputes** popping up from or connected to these terms? First, we'll try to sort it out nicely, with friendly chats between us. If that doesn't fly, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Game on! 🧑‍⚖️
