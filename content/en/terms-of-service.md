# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it "the Site" or "us" from now on). Before you dive in and use our services, give these Terms of Service a good read. By clicking around or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. 😉

## 1. What We're All About (Service Introduction)
We're here to offer users some awesome paid subscription content and membership services! This includes, but isn't limited to, cool blog articles, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interaction. Heads up though: some of this stellar content is exclusively for our subscribed users. ✨

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- To register an account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and create a password. Easy peasy!
- You're totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for all the activity happening on it. Oh, and transferring or sharing your account? That's a **big no-no**! 🙅‍♀️
- If you break these terms, we reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just a heads up!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services work on a monthly/annual billing cycle, and the fees are transparently displayed on the checkout page. No surprises! 💸
- All payments are handled by awesome third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, we **won't store** your payment info directly on our end! Your security is key. 🔒
- Your subscription is set to **auto-renew**, so keep that in mind! Make sure to hit that cancel button before your current billing cycle ends if you want to stop.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: For first-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email via the contact info at the end of these terms and let us know why you're bouncing. Heads up: it's one refund per user, period! If it's been over 14 days, or if this isn't your first rodeo, then **no take-backs on payments** after purchase, unless the law absolutely forces our hand. 😬

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All our original content **belongs to the Site (hubtoday)**, so please, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our explicit go-ahead! That's just good manners. 😉
- You, as a user, only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to access our stuff for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal library pass! 📚
- If you're looking for commercial use or want to quote us extensively, just hit us up to get our permission! We're usually pretty friendly. 😊

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's a **huge no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things chill and respectful, okay? ✌️
- **Absolutely forbidden**: Using technical tricks to mass download, scrape, or hack into our member-exclusive content. Seriously, don't do it! 🚫
- We can totally remove any inappropriate content and will **boot rule-breakers** right off the Site. You've been warned! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Just so you know, we can totally change, pause, or even yank some or all of our services whenever we need to, and **no heads-up required**. It's just how the tech cookie crumples sometimes! 🍪
- If content temporarily goes poof and becomes inaccessible because of stuff out of our control (think: force majeure, server hiccups, or when other services we rely on go down), we **can't really be held responsible for any damages**. It's a bummer, we know! 😔

## 7. Disclaimer (A Quick Heads-Up!)
- The info we dish out on the Site is just for informational purposes, folks. It definitely **does not** constitute any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Always consult a pro for that! 🤓
- We **can't be held liable** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. The Law of the Land (Governing Law)
- These Terms of Service are pretty much run by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA 🇺🇸, with no messy conflicts of law stuff here.
- For any disputes popping up from or related to these terms, we'll try to iron them out through friendly chats first. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts that have jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🙏
